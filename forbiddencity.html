            The Tiananmen ("Gate of Heavenly Peace"), a gate in the wall of the
            Imperial City, was built in 1415 during the Ming dynasty. In the
            17th century, fighting between Li Zicheng's rebel forces and the
            forces of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty caused heavy damage to, or
            even destroyed, the gate. Tiananmen Square was designed and built in
            1651, and was enlarged fourfold in the 1950s.

        <h2 class="h2_forbidden">History</h2>
        <p>Built in the 15th century, the Forbidden City of Beijing has a history spanning six centuries, including five as an imperial residence, the last century having undergone the lives of modern history.

            The Forbidden City is the third imperial palace to be built in Beijing. The first was built during the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234), the second during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), and the Forbidden City was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). To understand the history of the Forbidden City, it is necessary to begin a century and a half before its construction, at the time of the seizure of the power of the Yuan dynasty.

        <h2 class="h2_forbidden">Description</h2>
     <p>The Forbidden City is a magnificent ensemble of buildings surrounded by a rectangular area in the center of Beijing, the capital of China. Nowadays it is perfectly preserved and allows to see its architecture with precision.</p>

        <h2 class="h2_forbidden">Visit</h2>   
    <p>The Forbidden City is a fantastic monument to Beijing, but it is unfortunately very rare for people who have this opportunity, because the Chinese capital is full of treasures to visit, without counting the inevitable excursions to the Great Wall of China which occupies a good time spent there. It is a shame because even if only half of the forbidden city is visited, there is so much to see and do not spend a few hours can be frustrating</p>
